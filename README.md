# Academia-Projects
These projects were part of my assignments during my study period. 
**1. Cycling Analysis:**
I first combined the two data frames to keep only those rows of data that appear in both data frames so that we have complete data for every row.
Then I removed other forms of commutes and MTB rides as our focus is only on cycling. These were the initial data-cleaning processes that were done to proceed with the actual analysis.
